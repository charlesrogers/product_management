# Product Management Process
This document outlines my general product management process. 
+ Credentials?
+ Ethos (why did I write ethos? I don't even know what that means)
+ Request for input
## What Should We Do?
The most intriguing questions for product researchers are often:
+ "[Which products and services should we create?](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_management/blob/master/README.md#what-to-build)"
+ "[What should we do to get people to use our products and services?](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_research/blob/master/README.md#how-to-get-people-to-use-what-you-build)"
## What to Build
The general idea of what to build is something that is benefitial for your target user enough so that there is some value you can capture and you're both happy about the transaction.
Prinicpal in that relationship is discovering your target users' objectives and the relative satisfaction with which they are currently achieved to know where to focus. This is a challening and intriguing proposition and can be likened to creating a "map" of the market, highlighting which sections are fertile for investment. Additionally, if you discover something suficiently important yet unsatisfied and solve it in a material way you can still get much wrong and succeed (though if you don't, nothing really matters).

1. [Determine what people want](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_research/blob/master/qualitative_research/discover_objectives.md) via qualitative interviews
2. [Measure how badly they want it](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_research/blob/master/quantitative_research/survey_creation.md) via a qualitative study
3. [Determine what to build by prioritizing opportunities](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_research/blob/master/product_prioritization.md) according to what will have the largest return on investment for the business

## How to Get People to *Use* What You Build
The mixed methods approach adopted from ODI is primarily focused on *what* people want, while [JTBD by the Rewired group](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_research/blob/master/customers_acquisition.md) is often focused on *how* to get people to buy.
Getting people to buy requires you to understand the causal forces that promote their search and then the contextual forces that guide their decision making process (and then be close enough on the functionality they need). In other words, it's possible to build the right thing but not ever get any customers because it doesn't look like what they are looking for, nor is it where they are looking.

## What to read next
Now that you have an overview of what can be done, it's up to you to decide where you are:
+ If you know what your customers want but don't know how to get them to buy, look into the Customer Acquisition methodologies
+ If you know what your customers are trying to accomplish but don't know what
