## What Should We Build?
The most intriguing questions for product researchers are often "what should we build?" and "what should we do to get people to use our product/service".
What to build is most frequently thought of as the purview of research and product, but how to get people to adopt it will also be explored
### What to Build
Concerning what to build, the process of discovering the objectives and the relative satisfaction with which they are achieved is a challening and intriguing proposition and can be likened to creating a "map" of the market, highlighting which sections are fertile for investment. Additionally, "what to build" is such a vital question, for if you get it right, everything sings, but if you don't, nothing really works.

1. [Determine what people want](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_research/blob/master/qualitative_research/discover_objectives.md) via qualitative interviews
2. [Measure how badly they want it](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_research/blob/master/quantitative_research/survey_creation.md) via a qualitative study
3. [Determine what to build by prioritizing opportunities](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_research/blob/master/product_prioritization.md) according to what will have the largest return on investment for the business

### How to Get People to *Use* What You Build
The mixed methods approach adopted from ODI is primarily focused on *what* people want, while [JTBD by the Rewired group](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_research/blob/master/customers_acquisition.md) is often focused on *how* to get people to buy.
Getting people to buy requires you to understand the causal forces that promote their search and then the contextual forces that guide their decision making process (and then be close enough on the functionality they need). In other words, it's possible to build the right thing but not ever get any customers because it doesn't look like what they are looking for, nor is it where they are looking.
