# Qualitative Analysis

There are a few types of qual research, but here we're going to start describing why a user is doing something.

## Analysis Process
After doing the interviews
- Review every interview and note which factors seem related to the variable of interest
- Create a spreadsheet, list every user as a row header and every factor as a column header
- Mark each column with a 1 if the variable applies and 0 if it doesn't
- Sort by 1 for each column and see which factors apply to which users, then see what other factors connect those users
