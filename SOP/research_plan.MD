How to create a research plan

When you need to investigte something, often the origins of the investigation are hidden, so to start it sometimes helps to focus on the underlying goals:
1. Goaks/Anti-goals
  1. Abstract up one level of goal. For example, if someone asks you to investigate how to improve notifications, you should think one level higher about how notifications lead to reveneue and how they help users
  1. What are you trying *not* to break? For example, if the goal is to increase revenue through notifications, what needs to *not* happen to make that work well? You should watch people who turn off notifications, people's sentiment worstening (eg decrease in NPS), and churn.
1. User Goals
  1. What is the user trying to accomplish related to this area
  1. 
1. Base Rates: Once you know what goals the user has, you can look around to see what are good standards to compare this too to determine what success should look like (maybe you're already at an asymtote and should focus elsewhere)
