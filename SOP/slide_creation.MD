# Slide Creation
## Qual-based slides

## Quant-based Slides:
1. Write title for the general question at hand: Eg "How frequently labels are used"
1. Write hypotheses
1. Generate graphic to explore data 
  1. Prompt" "Create an analysis that {} and creates a table in gt that contains 
    1. Columns:   
      1. % of {}
      1. % of {}
      1. % of users 
    1. Rows 
      1. {}
      1. {}
      1. {}
    1. Uses gt_rows to color  colum {} with khroma:bam
1. Analyze data output from data
  1. Describe data
    1. What is the min, max, mean, median, sd?
    1. 
  1. Note what is confirmatory or different from hypotheses
  1. What is interesting?
    1. What is the significance/second order effects of these facts?
    1. Why is this the case?
    1. Primary behavior
      1.What is the primary use case as a result of this data?
    1. Secondary/Nascent behaviors
      1. What latent demand might be indicated by nascent behaviors?
      1. What user segments might be teased out as a result of nascent behavior?
    1. What impact would this have on...
    1. What impact would this have on the interface?
      1. Consider what are good metaphors for these findings (eg users do x which is like SLACK vs Hubspot)
  1. Note which new questions result from these second order effects and add new slide stubs (slide + headline describing what to analyze) to be filled out later
1. Write body copy
1. *ONLY* you have created the body copy, update graphic with issues 
1. Rewrite title with signficance of the data found
1. 


# Prompts:
+ Create an analysis that takes deduplicated {} and looks {} in the {} stage and breaks down the top 100 used {}, filtered by {} used by more than 5 users
+
