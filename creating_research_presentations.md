## Presentation Checklist
1. Start with the context
1. Models should exclusive
1. Categorize things by type    
1. Profile
    + Objective
    + Challenge to objective
    + Opportunity for them
1. Be explicit
    + "Viability" or "confidence" vs "
1. Narrative
    + Each slide should convey (typically) one message clearly
1. Anticipate Questions
1. Tell what is coming on the next slide so people don't have to wonder about a specific doubt they might have and let them know they don't need to get it out so they don't forget
### Stylistic Suggestions
+ Visual Hierarchy
+ Give the context for each slide
  + If explaining multiple points all within a category or theme, include way-finding headings at the top on each page reminds the viewer what they are looking at
+ Highlight what has changed between groups
+ Use terms that talk about the impact _beyond_ the research process... i.e. describe the impact on the business or the user
