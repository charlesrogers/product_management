How to create an accurate model of the world? Create a theory that explains the largest variance with the fewest number of moving parts.
It’s not easy , but it’s fun.

1.	Create a hypothesis
2.	Create a test to invalidate/corroborate the hypothesis
3.	Execute the test
4.	Observe the data
5.	Describe the data
a.	Theory: “Researchers in this step often develop abstractions from the messy detail of phenomena that we term constructs. Constructs help us understand and visualize what the phenomena are, and how they operate.” (Carlile, 2004)
6.	Categorize the observations.
a.	Theory: “In the descriptive stage of theory building, the classification schemes that scholars propose typically are defined by the attributes of the phenomena. [...] Such categorization schemes attempt to simplify and organize the world in ways that highlight possibly consequential relationships between the phenomena and the outcomes of interest.” (Ibid.)
b.	You can group by:
i.	Motivation
1.	“Rather than using schemes based on attributes of the phenomena, however, they develop categories of the different situations or circumstances in which managers might find themselves. They do this by asking, when they encounter an anomaly, “What was it about the situation in which those managers found themselves, that caused the causal mechanism to yield a different result?” (Ibid.)
ii.	Quantity
c.	Look for outliers and anomalies
i.	“It is only when an anomaly is identified – an outcome for which the theory can’t account – that an opportunity to improve theory occurs.” (Ibid.)
ii.	How to discover anomalies
1.	When might [x] be bad ideas? 
2.	Are there circumstances in which [the sub-optimal process] yield better results than [the “best” option]? 
3.	When do users do something we wouldn’t expect?
4.	What are the strengths and weaknesses of each option?
5.	What are the right situations for X? For Y?
6.	What if we look at things at different scales—within the different departments of an organization instead of at the organization level?
iii.	What to do when you discover an anomaly:
1.	More accurately describing and measuring what the phenomena are and are notC
2.	Changing the definitions by which the phenomena or the circumstances are categorized – adding or eliminating categories or defining them in different ways
3.	Articulating a new theoretical statement of what is associated with, or causes what, and why, and under what circumstances. (Ibid.)
iv.	Understanding the outliers or anomalies is generally the key to discovering a new categorization scheme. 
7.	Define the relationships
a.	Explain the causal forces
i.	“[R]esearchers explore the association between the category-defining attributes and the outcomes observed. In the stage of descriptive theory building, researchers recognize and make explicit what differences in attributes, and differences in the magnitude of those attributes, correlate most strongly with the patterns in the outcomes of interest. Techniques such as regression analysis typically are useful in defining these correlations. Often we refer to the output of studies at this step as models.” (Ibid.)
8.	Test
a.	Internal Validity
i.	Its conclusions are logically drawn from its premises
ii.	The researchers have ruled out all plausible alternative explanations that might link the phenomena with the outcomes of interest.
b.	External Validity
i.	The extent to which a relationship that was observed between phenomena and outcomes in one context can be trusted to apply in different contexts as well


Objective:
A theory completes the transition from descriptive to normative when it can give a manager unambiguous guidance about what actions will and will not lead to the desired result, given the circumstance in which she finds herself. (Ibid.)

The goal is to move from demographics to circumstances.
