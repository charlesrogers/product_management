# Measuring Output of Research
## Measure each of the following rated on a scale of 1-5:
- How actionable are these insights? (weight 3)
- How accurate are these insights? (weight 3)
- How clearly expressed are the insights? (weight 1)
## Example:
- How actionable (OED definition) are these insights? (5 * 3)
- How accurate are these insights? (4 * 3)
- How clearly expressed are the insights? (5* 1)
33/35=94%
## Accuracy can be measured by predictive model
- between x - y = 5
- between a - b = 4
- between d - f = 3
- between h - i = 2
- between t - u = 1
## Relative Accuracy
The scale is taken from a base-rate repository of accuracy
Or should accuracy be about mutual trust?
