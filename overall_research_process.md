# End-to-End Research Process

## Research objective: 
Create an objective measurement of opportunities to improve the business/de-risk the decision making process.
## Research Process
1. Alignment
  1. Determine Business Objective
### What is the KPI?
+ Increase the rate of users in India who do X
### What is the Counter KPI?
+ Maintain the user satisfaction rate while doing X
## Determine Scope
### Create Research Plan
1. State hypotheses
2. Break hypotheses into underlying factors
#### Project timeline
##### 1st round of Discovery (D1) (1-4 weeks, depending on the scope of the project and your familiarity with the subject matter) ⅰ. Answer questions with
+ Analyze Current Behavioral Data
  + With existing products, the first step is to analyze the current funnel, looking for key dropoffs in the flow.
    + Consider the business fundimentals and work back from a target revenue number... For example, if you need to have $xxx,xxx revenue during a certain time period, you can play with the levers to see which factors matter most. Often times, though, you'll need to increase things at the top of the funnel, especially if some of your conversion rates are <1%
    + Rank by % dropoff 
+ Qualitative interviews - Understand the landscape (Who, what, where, when, why)
  + Determine the objectives
  + What are they trying to accomplish (ie objectives)?
  + Who does it (eg roles, organizations)?
  + How do they do it/what are the steps in their process?
  + What tools do they use?
  + When we stop learning material new things we are done with initial discovery / Interview enough buyers that you know the objectives to the different groups
+ 1st Round of Findings
  + High-level journey map (see below)
  + Define objectives
+ Code and count them
+ Create frameworks to explain behaviors
  + Identify causal forces in behavior
  + Categorize users by the factors that explain the largest differences in behavior
  + Segmented groups by their needs & identifying factors: Eg “x buyers want y and you can tell who they are by z behavior on the platform” 
    + How to identify your segments through click data is often the most difficult 
+ Create presentation 
+ Review findings
+ Determine direction
+ Measure outcomes
+ Quantitative measurement of user objectives discovered D1
+ Create a survey
  + Quantify opportunities 
    + For sample output, see "Objectives + Validation" at the bottom of this sheet 
    + Qual/quant review of current solution and competitors: Review the current solution and competitors, measuring how successful both are at helping the user achieve their objectives. Those objectives should be previously defined and a clear scale of measurement should be defined and used in order to determine the magnitude of change (+/-) in progress the solutions will provide in helping users achieve their objectives. 
    + See Usability Testing Guide 
    + See "Validation Rubric" below 
  + Present findings
+ Insights
  + Importance
  + Level of performance currently provided by the market
+ Opportunities
+ Recommendation
  + Prioritization framework
  + High-level product vision
  + Alignment
    + Agree upon focus
    + Agree what is out of scope
    + Agree on timeline
    + Define clear KPIs
+ Solutions
  + Determine strategy
  + Determine which objectives need to be satisfied to achieve objectives
  + Determine which functionalities would help a user achieve the objective in a superior manner
  + Prototype functionality
  + Create a high-level visual expression of the solution to help work through the complexity
  + Validate problem-solution fit
  + Determine Solution feasibility
    + Understand scope and ROI for each solution for each of:
    + Buyer
    + Supplier
    + Operations
    + Engineering
    + Marketing
+ Create prototype (solutions)
+ Validate solutions
+ Engineering
+ Release
+ Measure
+ Iterate Objectives + Validation Journey Map Validation Rubric Opportunity Charles to merge the following into the above document
+ Solutions
  + Determine the right strategy for the solution (what creates long-term value)
  + Review the objectives of the buyer, supplier, business
  + Review the durability of the solution over time
+ Understand problem-solution fit (“Pre-validation”)
  + Validate problem:
    + “You said x is a problem, how much would something that did specifically y improve your situation?” (Likert 1-5)
    + Measure demand for potential solutions (and execution)
    + How important is it for x to be executed perfectly?
    + They supply the performance criteria, but:
      + No mistakes
      + Minimal time
      + Optimal outcome
        + If you could do x vs y, which would be more valuable?
        + In which ways would x not meet your objective?
+ Create prototypes
  + Get the core functionality right
  + Get the details right
  + What data is available
  + What is the right ROI
  + How to make the process appropriately simple
  + What is in-scope vs out of scope
  + Release
    + Measure
  + Iterate Concepts to Incorporate Above: Do not wait to develop ideas or rough prototypes until after you've determined the demand—ideas are fragile and can be nourished into something akin to magic, but they require care. Leaving them alone too long can make that viable (and high-producing) seeds can wither from neglect. The initial prototyping (e.g. pen on paper, wireframes) can help a nebulous concept become far more well understood.
