# How to Create Objectives
## What is the Appropriate Level to Frame the Objectives?
V devised a nice framework to explain the different levels of objectives:
1. Business level: Maximize profit profit
2. Job level: The role specific job itself - eg "Sell more products" or "Find the right products for internal use"
3. Step level: The context-specific job  - eg. "Source products in order to resell them"
4. Process step level: A critical step in order to achieve the intermediate job (at Level 2) - eg. "Evaluate suppliers"
5. Objective/Metric Level - eg "determine on-time delivery rate"
6. Tactical step level: Tactics or techniques that are used in order to achieve a process step - eg. "Learn from other people what they thought of their experience sourcing from that supplier
7. Consumption Chain Level: how long to understand the tool that helps you accomplish the objective
## Meta Jobs:
• Objectives specifically related to using the product - eg. "Find repeat order data", "Sign up quickly"
• Objectives related to internal processes that don't directly accomplish the job (but are more around reducing variability/cost/mistakes when accomplishing the context-specific (level 2 job - "Submit pre-PO approval request to supervisor") but may be company specific. Very similar to product meta job, but it's service related...
• If it applies to every step, a potential solution is abstracting it up a level and just asking it once:
• Minimize the likelihood of not following established processes in the organization  TRUE  3	1	Optional	Is this about forgetting? Is this about not making your bosses angry? > Should we abstract up a level and say something like "Minimize the number of internal preventable mistakes"
When stuck on an objective, it might be helpful to identify at which level it is located:
This seems like it's "Sell Products > Find Suppliers > Vet Supplier > Determine Supplier's Business Stability > Determine financial stability"
Probability/risk (and thus "Likelihood" objectives) seem to be more relevant when there is hidden risk...
Go deeper on the objectives that are more directly relevant to the project and higher level for the adjacent objectives.
When presenting solutions, is it better to write the solution to a higher or more specific level?
For example, when trying to determine what solution to build, and cross-validating against previous interviews and considering the needs of a US-based medical device company:
• Level X - Minimize time to find a supplier who complies with regulations
• Level Y
• Obj A. Minimize time to find a supplier located in the United States
• Obj B. Minimize time to find a supplier who is FDA compliant
Level Y - A is useful to many people, but applies to lots of industries
Level Y - B is useful to , but applies to one industry
## Which Levels to Include
The more relevant to the business/project at-hand, the more specific (lower level) we typically should focus. 
## Merge or Split
Scope
## Testing Objectives
When we are not sure of what level of objective to ask at...
### Time to Identify vs Resolve?
• What about resolution? Should we still ask about sometimes we can't do anything about it.
Themes
• Accuracy
• Risk
### What level do we ask at?
• When you ask at the solution level, it can solve two outcomes, so it solves the problem of which to ask about, but we lose data on what actually mattered to the user.
• We don't know if we want to ask about time or quality, so ask about production process
• Option A
• Minimize the likelihood the supplier makes changes to the production process without my knowledge
• Option B
• Minimize the time it takes to assess changes in supplier's quality performance
• Minimize the time it takes to assess changes in supplier's on-time delivery performance
• If you ask one level higher (for the outcome), it might be lest relevant
### Likelihood vs Magnitude
For problems that are not that preventable, we likely do not not want to ask whether they want to minimize the likelihood of the event—these are ones that involve risk that is inherent to the system...
Eg. minimize the risk of earth being in the path of an asteroid
But we can ask about whether they want to minimize the likelihood of it actually happening, because TECHNICALLY it is possible to influence.
So we have to determine how determinate the event is.
But maybe the best way to do it is to ask about mitigating the impact?
Likely: Binary - prevent
Magnitude: Continuous - mitigate
For low probability ones, leave high level (we're basically finish for interest, so can't go too specific)
#### Hidden risk
Risk that is created by how you make a decision vs risk is part of the system (inherent in doing what you are doing
e
#### Likelihood, For the Second time
Minimize likelihood of something bad happening (Minimize likelihood of ordering the incorrect amount)
OR
Minimize likelihood of something good not happening (Minimize likelihood of not ordering the correct amount)
Avoiding something bad happening seems to be slightly "juicing" it but the double negative of avoiding something good not happening is harder to read.... so we prefer the more neutral avoiding something not happening.
Preliminary verdict: Neutral. 
Minimize likelihood of running out of inventory for a product technically you can't control, and incorporates a lot more things.
Minimize likelihood of not ordering the correct amount - this can't control, but fewer variables involved
Minimize likelihood of reordering at the incorrect time - this you also can't control, but fewer variables involved
Others
Minimize the likelihood of using a payment method that will negatively impact cash flow 
Minimize the likelihood  cash flow will be negatively affected by payment method
#### Issues with Juicing
What are we actually doing when we are juicing?
merging solution with value proposition?
## Open Questions
### Should we measure outcomes Independently 
### Ask about the last experience, not average
De-generalize
### Synthetic vs Observed
Only use synthetic when you are pretty sure it should or it is high risk to not include or you have more space and you can "guess and check"
### Determine vs Confirm
Determine if no specific outcome is desired (use less often)
Confirm if specific out come is desired ("Determine if"  is the same and shouldn't be used)
### Complexity Factor
Something that will change your answer to an outcome
You need the outcome and the complexity factor
