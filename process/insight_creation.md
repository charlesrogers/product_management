# Insight Process
## Introduction (What is it)
The creation of a model of reality (or, in a simpler form, an "insight") goes through various stages. 
You'll likely start by first noticing something—maybe someone says they did something because of something else, or maybe something preceded another.
## Process of Distilling an Insight into a Model (How)
## Which Phenomena Deserve to be Modeled?
### Recommended Things to Share
### Something Provides Clarity
### Refining a Model
### Caveats
#### Be Wary When Extrapolating from One Data Point
The less data we have the more general we should make the insight
### Stages of an Insight
1. Observe
2. Classify
3. Create model
4. Test
5. Create causal model

## How to Write an Insight
This is just one suggestion:
1. Write 1 sentence for each interesting, remarkable, poignant, peculiar, or confusing thing you observed—this ideally will just involve looking through your key findings for each interview and selecting anything that still seems interesting after letting it sit for a while.
2. Flush out the reason why it is interesting
a. Ask "why" until it is no longer interesting.
3. Explore what likely caused the observation to happen.
4. Establish the bounds around which the insight is applicable 
a. Eg.
## Standard Output Format
This is not required, but often a useful way to present a finding
### Headline
At a basic level the headline can tell the theme of what will follow but ideally it would also clearly its explain the importance, significance, novelty or newsworthiness.
The title should also incite curiosity in the reader by explaining what is exciting (and, if necessary, why it matters, but that typically will be evident for all but the most complex insights).
### Explanation
The body paragraph should explain the insight, including to which situations it applies and which it does not.
### Story
Then we can tell the story, hopefully including a quote.
### Illustration
If possible, we can illustrate the relationships/competing forces/timeline with a figure/graph.
### Quantification
If you have data, hopefully explaining the ratio vs the rest of the cases.
## Examples of Insights in Standard Format
Below are two example of insights that focus on an idea that is ...
Trend: Digitization Replacing Trade Shows & Traditional Selling
### What is Worth Sharing?
#### Tend Toward Insights that Change Slowly
Almost categorically, long-term insights are less about a reaction to a specific Alibaba system.
However, it is entirely appropriate to share insights that might only be relevant as long as the current  interface is in place and then (especially when it is currently insufficient [and even better when we can recommend a clear course of action]).
## Accuracy is paramount
We should not make statements beyond what we are quite certain (~80% certainty) are true. This more often than not means making specific statements instead of general ones, and frequently will result in us sitting on a shocking insight for a week or two while we figure out to which situations it applies and to which it does not.
This uncertainty is not unexpected—causality is hard to determine (even with plenty of data), but even a limited number of time-focused quantitative explorations can produce high-certainty statements of causality, it just requires one to be specific about the parameters/conditions in which the statement is applicable (typically limited to the classes observed in the exploration).
Finally, if we have good reason to believe something, but aren't quite certain enough to feel confident to make an unqualified statement it is appropriate to add a caveat such as "we'll further corroborate this insight with an upcoming survey."
## Novelty is Not Required
What we share doesn't have to be novel, but it should be interesting. Observations typically go from a first observation, to a working theory, to  quantification, which means it's entirely appropriate to share something 3 times (as it progresses through each of those phases of lifecycle).
## Things that Make it Hard
### Categorization
### Causality
### Information
## Practical Tips
## Make it Algebraic when Dealing With Causality
When you write a causal statement, it is possible to represent it in at least three equal and interchangeable ways:
1. Directed Acyclic Graph
2. Algebraically
3. Sentence format
## Evaluating an Insight
### Anonymize
Below is an example of a true statement that feels like it could do more
>Users that take the time to talk and evaluate vendors in more depth tend to have high satisfaction levels because they are making sure the supplier will meet their requirements.
This statement is very likely true, I just want to quickly explore out loud what "independent information" it provides—in other words, what does it teach us that couldn't be already explained by something else. I am borrowing this concept (likely very incorrectly) from "mutual information".
If we anonymize the statement up 2 levels, we could convert it to:
2. buyers who do {x{ experience {y}
and then down one level:
1. buyers who {do the right thing} experience {satisfaction}
It's sort of like saying "the people who are most successful work the hardest."
In that case, it is almost axiomatic/self-evident, and then might not bear mentioning.
If the observation is based off of survey data, there may be a lurking variable and satisfaction may be better explained by something else.
## Universality vs Specificity
If a statement is made that makes a claim about a specific group it should pass the specificity test—does this apply equally to other similar groups? If so, abstract it up a level to their shared category (as much as possible). It is also appropriate to use inversion—if the list is shorter—to enumerate to whom the statement does not apply.
If the statement likely equally applies to everyone perhaps the group should be removed.
## Lack of Self-referentiality
Ideally our process is invisible—if possible we should be able to present information without having to explain the methodology before the insight. In other words, the insight should be presented clearly first, and if any scaffolding is needed it can be provided once the audience is curious (typically after we make a exciting statement that needs backing up). 
## Concepts
+ Mutual information: joint dependance
+ Dimensionality reduction

## How to Measure the Impact of your Insight
### Number of Viewers
### Re-quotes
### Impact
## Stylistic Measures (Nice to Haves)
### Brevity
KPI: A simple KPI would be  communicating the appropriate message with the fewest number of characters.
Counter KIP: Time to understand the concept
---RAW THOUGHTS TO INTEGRATE---
I think the sunk-cost lens might be less predictive than whether they are currently satisfied with their solutions (vs not having any). I think it might be circular to say "they didn't switch to Alibaba because they were happy with their solutions." I think we need to look at the times when they were looking for new solutions:
Doug didn't have any examples when HE had to find new suppliers, but did express at least one blocking criteria (Chinese quality being perceived as inferior).
The lady from Nebraska DID mention looking, but she was able to find what she wanted to find via google (so we didn't rank high enough... an awareness issue AND likely we didn't have enough US-based suppliers).
Shashank did use Alibaba, but only for non-medical things (so we could evaluate things based on his Share of Wallet... he does use use Alibaba when the products do not need to be FDA-approved or there is not a high enough volume (cost savings) to justify the extra work of going abroad.
I think he mentioned he would also have to find people over there to handle the inspection, so he is missing critical infrastructure which increases the amount of work required to begin to manufacture in a new geography.
We also spoke to that crawl-space door brand, who does use Alibaba, but only when they don't go to trade shows.
