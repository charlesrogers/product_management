# End-to-End Research Process

## Research objective: 
Create an objective measurement of opportunities to improve the business/de-risk the decision making process.
## Research Process
a. Alignment
ⅰ. Determine Business Objective
### What is the KPI?
+ Increase the rate of users in India who do X
### What is the Counter KPI?
+ Maintain the user satisfaction rate while doing X
## Determine Scope
### Create Research Plan
1. State hypotheses
2. Break hypotheses into underlying factors
#### Project timeline
##### 1st round of Discovery (D1) (1-4 weeks, depending on the scope of the project and your familiarity with the subject matter) ⅰ. Answer questions with
Current behavioral data
Qualitative interviews - Understand the landscape (Who, what, where, when, why) ⅰ. Determine the objectives ⅱ. What are they trying to accomplish (ie objectives)? ⅲ. Who does it (eg roles, organizations)? ⅳ. How do they do it/what are the steps in their process? ⅴ. What tools do they use? ⅵ. When we stop learning material new things we are done with initial discovery / Interview enough buyers that you know the objectives to the different groups b. 1st Round of Findings ⅰ. High-level journey map (see below) ⅱ. Define objectives
Code and count them ⅲ. Create frameworks to explain behaviors
Identify causal forces in behavior ⅳ. Categorize users by the factors that explain the largest differences in behavior ⅰ. Segmented groups by their needs & identifying factors
Eg “x buyers want y and you can tell who they are by z behavior on the platform” a. How to identify them through click data is often the most difficult ⅱ. Create presentation ⅲ. Review findings ⅳ. Determine direction c. Measurement ⅰ. Quantitative measurement of user objectives discovered D1
Create a survey
Quantify opportunities a. For sample output, see "Objectives + Validation" at the bottom of this sheet ⅱ. Qual/quant review of current solution and competitors
Review the current solution and competitors, measuring how successful both are at helping the user achieve their objectives. Those objectives should be previously defined and a clear scale of measurement should be defined and used in order to determine the magnitude of change (+/-) in progress the solutions will provide in helping users achieve their objectives. ⅰ. See Usability Testing Guide ⅱ. See "Validation Rubric" below ⅲ. Present findings
Insights a. Importance b. Level of performance currently provided by the market
Opportunities
Recommendation a. Prioritization framework b. High-level product vision d. Alignment ⅰ. Agree upon focus ⅱ. Agree what is out of scope ⅲ. Agree on timeline ⅳ. Define clear KPIs e. Solutions ⅰ. Determine strategy
Determine which objectives need to be satisfied to achieve objectives
Determine which functionalities would help a user achieve the objective in a superior manner ⅱ. Prototype functionality
Create a high-level visual expression of the solution to help work through the complexity ⅲ. Validate problem-solution fit ⅳ. Solution feasibility
Understand scope and ROI for each solution for each of
Buyer, Supplier, Operations, Engineering
Create prototype (solutions)
Validate solutions
Engineering
Release
Measure
Iterate Objectives + Validation Journey Map Validation Rubric Opportunity Charles to merge the following into the above document ⅰ. Solutions
Determine the right strategy for the solution (what creates long-term value) a. Review the objectives of the buyer, supplier, business b. Review the durability of the solution over time
Understand problem-solution fit (“Pre-validation”) a. Validate problem: ⅰ. “You said x is a problem, how much would something that did specifically y improve your situation?” (Likert 1-5) b. Measure demand for potential solutions (and execution) ⅰ. How important is it for x to be executed perfectly?
They supply the performance criteria, but: a. No mistakes b. Minimal time c. Optimal outcome ⅱ. If you could do x vs y, which would be more valuable? ⅲ. In which ways would x not meet your objective?
Create prototypes a. Get the core functionality right b. Get the details right ⅰ. What data is available ⅱ. What is the right ROI ⅲ. How to make the process appropriately simple c. What is in-scope vs out of scope ⅱ. Release ⅲ. Measure ⅳ. Iterate Concepts to Incorporate Above • Do not wait to develop ideas or rough prototypes until after you've determined the demand—ideas are fragile and can be nourished into something akin to magic, but they require care. Leaving them alone too long can make that viable (and high-producing) seeds can wither from neglect. The initial prototyping (e.g. pen on paper, wireframes) can help a nebulous concept become far more well understood.
