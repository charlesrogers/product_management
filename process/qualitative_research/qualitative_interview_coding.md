# Qualitative Interview Coding & Synthesis
## Interview Coding
Here are the Meta objectives we want to accomplish while executing an interview:
1. Minimize the effort to extract new objectives
2. Minimize the effort to code new objectives 
3. Minimize the effort to code an existing objective
4. Minimize the effort to capture the context associated with an objected
5. Minimize the time to find what you're looking for when reviewing a previously coded interview
6. Make everything we know about users legible (searchable)
### Individual Interview
+ Diagram journey by creating the timeline of the buyer's journey: For each user, write what their journey was
+ Extract the user's objectives/goals
+ Understand why they prioritize what they prioritize by determining root causes
  + Create DAG by diagraming the material forces at play for each decision
  + Determine which tradeoffs were made
+ Identify and diagram switch/decision moments using the Four Forces model
+ Start with the research objectives &  try and answer to questions
+ Extract meaningful quotes

### Cross-Interview Synthesis
+ Compare & Contrast individual journeys in order to understand relationship between how people
  + What is different & similar between people
+ Create a storyline to help others understand (the research questions/relationship between the factors)


## Research Synthesis Guide
1. Start with the research guide and start answering questions (objectives & hypotheses)
a. Questions
b. Findings
c. 
## How to do synthesis:
1. Break down insights into:
a. Context
ⅰ. "When I am..."
b. Objectives
ⅰ. "So I can..."
c. Tactics
ⅰ. "I do this..."
1. Work arounds
2. Alternatives
3. Non-consumption
4. 
It's likely better to do it as it goes instead of waiting until the end and having to remember everything.
1. Do x
2. Do y
3. Do z
Presentation materials
• Create timeline
• Create forces diagram
• List buyer objectives
## Group information by:
• Interface improvements
• Data improvements
• Buyer objectives
• Evaluate compared to the KPIs, conversion rate
## Output
1. Alignment
2. Clear decision on what to do next
## How to write a synthesis
+ Get it all out there
+ When stuck, reread what is written
+ Reread notes
+ Create a quick framework, then look at it and see how it breaks, refactor
+ Break apart statements that describe two forces at work 
### Validation
+ Try and poke holes in it logically:
+ What evidence would prove x wrong?
+ If you were a lawyer on the other side what would your argument be?
+ What do you want to be true?
+ What is the best critique of x you’ve come across?
+ Demand measurement
+ BATNA
+ Data analysis
+ DISTRIBUTIONS NOT AVERAGES

## INTERVIEW CODING
Best Practices
1. Make sure you know what you want to know before you get started
2. Start with the end in mind:
3. Database of codes
4. Emergent codes
5. Quickly find
### Coding Categories
1. Desired Outcome
2. Context - Causal forces
a. What was the change that resulted in the desire to accomplish the objective
ⅰ. Dissatisfaction
ⅱ. Desired value
3. Requirements - How the job is currently done
a. What data is available
4. Efficiency - Doing the job better
5. Emotional
