# Qualitative Interview Coding & Synthesis
## Interview Coding
### Diagram journey
• Create the timeline of the buyer's journey
• Create DAG by diagraming the material forces at play for each decision
• Identify and diagram switch/decision moments using the Four Forces model

### Cross-Interview Synthesis
1. Start with the research objectives &  look for answers to questions
a. Individual Journey
ⅰ. For each user, write what their journey was
b. Compare & Contrast
2. Extract the user's objectives/goals
3. Understand why they prioritize what they prioritize
a. In order to understand relationship between how people 
ⅰ. Tradeoffs
ⅱ. What is different than other people
ⅲ. 
Meta
Extract meaningful quotes
Make everything we know about users legible (searchable)
Create a storyline to help others understand (the research questions/relationship between the factors)
Here are the Objectives we want to accomplish:
1. Minimize the effort to extract new objectives
2. Minimize the effort to code new objectives 
3. Minimize the effort to code an existing objective
4. Minimize the effort to capture the context associated with an objected
5. Minimize the time to find what you're looking for when reviewing a previously coded interview
Here is the proposed process:
1. 
Creating codes
1. List
2. Determine root cause
3. Group
4. Identify causal factors
Best Practices
1. Make sure you know what you want to know before you get started
2. Start with the end in mind:
3. Database of codes
4. Emergent codes
5. Quickly find
### Coding Categories
1. Desired Outcome
2. Context - Causal forces
a. What was the change that resulted in the desire to accomplish the objective
ⅰ. Dissatisfaction
ⅱ. Desired value
3. Requirements - How the job is currently done
a. What data is available
4. Efficiency - Doing the job better
5. Emotional

## Research Synthesis Guide
1. Start with the research guide and start answering questions (objectives & hypotheses)
a. Questions
b. Findings
c. 
## How to do synthesis:
1. Break down insights into:
a. Context
ⅰ. "When I am..."
b. Objectives
ⅰ. "So I can..."
c. Tactics
ⅰ. "I do this..."
1. Work arounds
2. Alternatives
3. Non-consumption
4. 
It's likely better to do it as it goes instead of waiting until the end and having to remember everything.
1. Do x
2. Do y
3. Do z
Presentation materials
• Create timeline
• Create forces diagram
• List buyer objectives
## Group information by:
• Interface improvements
• Data improvements
• Buyer objectives
• Evaluate compared to the KPIs, conversion rate
## Output
1. Alignment
2. Clear decision on what to do next
## How to write a synthesis
• Get it all out there
• When stuck, reread what is written
• Reread notes
• Create a quick framework, then look at it and see how it breaks, refactor
• Break apart statements that describe two forces at work 
Vetting
• Try and poke holes in it logically:
• What evidence would prove x wrong?
• If you were a lawyer on the other side what would your argument be?
• What do you want to be true?
• What is the best critique of x you’ve come across?
• Demand measurement
• BATNA
• Data analysis
• DISTRIBUTIONS NOT AVERAGES
