b. Push of the Current Situation
2. Impeding Forces

b. Habit
## Switching Cost Model
• How much better must something be to switch
• Tradeoffs between objectives when one gets worse to make another better (disruption)
• "Must haves" provide filtering criteria
• "Nice to haves" provide ranking criteria
• Do people use thresholds, or do they use ranks?
• When do they use each? 
• Is it relative?
• Maybe absolute distance matters more?
• Maybe you are trying to minimize total distance
• Perception questions
• Familiarity with x
• Gap between perception and reality
• There is probably a framework for this
• "Solution-specific" requirements (eg "I need US suppliers for my medical device company" OR "I need a manufacturer")
• When are they flexible?
• How flexible are they?
• Why do they happen?
