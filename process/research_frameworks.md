## Four Forces
The "Four Forces" are the motivating and impeding forces that affect progress.
+ Motiving forces
  + Attractiveness of the New Solution
  + Push of the Current Situation
+ Impeding Forces
  + Fear of the Unknown
  + Habit
## Switching Cost Model
+ How much better must something be to switch
+ Tradeoffs between objectives when one gets worse to make another better (disruption)
+ "Must haves" provide filtering criteria
+ "Nice to haves" provide ranking criteria
+ Do people use thresholds, or do they use ranks?
+ When do they use each? 
+ Is it relative?
+ Maybe absolute distance matters more?
+ Maybe you are trying to minimize total distance
+ Perception questions
+ Familiarity with x
+ Gap between perception and reality
+ There is probably a framework for this
+ "Solution-specific" requirements (eg "I need US suppliers for my medical device company" OR "I need a manufacturer")
+ When are they flexible?
+ How flexible are they?
+ Why do they happen?
