# Concept & Solution Validation
## Timeline to
1. Discover objectives and the user's current satisfaction
2. For unmet objectives, determine what would meet their needs
3. Generate a solution that meets the unmet needs
a. Focus less on the tradeoffs & real-world implications of the solution (only to the degree it is required to make the solution believable to the potential user (price, et al) and more on which things you believe that would sufficiently solve their problems
4. Verbal Prototype
5. Survey Demand Test
6. High-fidelity Prototype
## Process
Verbal & Initial Prototype
1. Measure the importance of the objective the problem is designed to solve
2. Measure the satisfaction with  current solutions
3. Test concepts with those where there is an opportunity to improve their process
a. Perhaps: 4-5 Importance, 1-4 Satisfaction, IMP > SAT
4. Determine where they are in the search process:
a. Don't feel pain
ⅰ. As mentioned above, it's possible to control for this as we're previously asking people about Importance and Satisfaction and we can just filter by those for whom there is opportunity for improvement.
b. Not yet looking for a solution
c. Passive looking - I.e. they know it is a problem and are open to solutions for that problem
d. Active looking
e. Deciding
f. Recently purchased
5. Present the  concept in a succinct manner
a. At the product level - for example: How likely you are to adopt:
1. An online tool that allows you to monitor all your orders and their status in one place
2. A service that provides suppliers who can dual source your existing products
b. At the feature level (aka Alexa style) - for example: How  likely would you be to adopt (an online tool) that:
ⅰ. Includes  all the features you indicated were important (i.e you rated a 3, 4, or 5).
ⅱ. @Lytle, Alexa(alexa.lytle) Could you post a screenshot of your survey here?
## High-fidelity Prototype
1. Wireframes et al
## General Guidelines
• Only test with people who have  the problem (or should have—understanding why they don't is helpful to understand to whom the solutions apply)
