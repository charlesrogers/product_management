# Survey Creation Process 
## Survey Creation
a. List objectives
b. List hypotheses you want to invalidate/corroborate
c. List questions that will invalidate/corroborate those hypotheses
ⅰ. Multiple choice
1. Make the  list of answers mutually exclusive
2. Make each list of answers exhaustive
ⅱ. Free text field
ⅲ. Multi-select
3. Process
a. Determine objective
b. Create rough draft in a collaborative tool
c. Review internally
d. Review with partners
e. Update survey
f. Review internally
g. Code survey in survey instrument
ⅰ. Add a introduction on the first page
ⅱ. Create the pages first
ⅲ. Give each page a descriptive name
ⅳ. Matrix questions
1. Randomize rows for Matrix questions
h. Check survey logic
ⅰ. PUT THE EMAIL ADDRESS QUESTION on the first page
i. Field survey
4. Survey fielding
a. Email
b. Message center
## Working with Collaborators
## Survey Review
### Review the survey by reading aloud the survey with a qualified respondent:
• Ask them if them to tell you when it is ambiguous
• Ask, "do you have any comments about this questions?"
• Ask "Are there any answers that are missing or confusing"?
• Ask, "Is it hard question to answer?"

### Don't Interchange Words
Don't use words like "seller" / "supplier", "good"/ "product", or "source" / "procure"interchangeably.
### External Terminology
• "Customer" not "buyer"
## Best Practices
### Review Timeframe
Depending on the length of the survey, it should take about 2 hours to review at least twice
### Coding Timeframe
Depending on the length and skip-logic, the survey should take anywhere from 2-4 (uninterrupted) hours to code
### Final Testing
1 hour to do the final test
### Use a collaborative tool BEFORE coding survey in survey instrument
Except in cases of the simplest surveys, it is best to design the survey in a collaborative word processor to allow for people to quickly see the flow, leave comments, and make suggestions without having to take  the survey multiple times
### Don't Use Automatic Outline Formatting
Don't use numbers provided by your word processes the outline template to denote which questions and sections should be used for the skip logic, but instead list their actual names
### Question Construction
#### Time & Money
When writing quantity questions (of time or money):
#### (Generally) Only include one variable in a question
When questions seem to break, it's likely because you are asking two questions in one. This is often when you create answers that include something like X AND Y or A AND B
#### Try and not use "Yes" or "No" Questions
Instead of asking "have you", ask "to which degree" questions in order to understand magnitude or frequency. It is more economical than breaking it into two questions
#### Not Applicable
#### Make sure your survey is logically consistent
If two answer cannot coexist, do not allow for them to be selected
#### Clarifying Questions
#### Standard formatting
• On next line vs in question
## Survey Validity
### Include trap questions
Standard Question Bank
Use this database of questions for all non-project-specific survey questions.
## Survey Review
Verbiage
Multiple Choice vs Multi-select
Make sure you have everything set up correctly so that 
### Review of Likert Questions
+ Require a response to all rows
+ Match Question to Ratings
+ Include "edge" cases in answer responses:
++ 0% as distinct from 1%
++ Not yet/Never

### LAST: Custom Questions/Piping Logic
Ensure you didn't accidentally change the order

## Ideas to explore
• Simulate results before fielding to see if you get the data you need...
## Survey Coding Checklist
1. Require an answer for every page
2. For every matrix question, ensure "all" rows must be selected
3. TRY AND AVOID MULTI-SELECT (checkboxes)
4. Make sure you have underlined/bolded important phrases
