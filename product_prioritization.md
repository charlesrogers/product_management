# Product Prioritization
The question at hand is the eternal, "What should we build?"  
When it comes to prioritizing a product there are some considerations 
+ How confident are you that know what people are trying to accomplish and the tradeoffs they would make?
+ What is the scope of solutions that you would consider? Are you interested in only doing sustain innvoations, adjacent features, or entirely new solution spaces.

## Process for High-Risk Situations
+ NPV of solutions
  + Likelihood to adopt * Number of Users * change in LTV (GMV  *  Churn Rate)
## Process for Low-Risk Situations

### TO FILE
Prioritization is a combination of business value * user value * what is feasible * what will create long-term value above the cost of capital
1. Business value
    + What is the overall funnel
     + What are the steps in the funnel
       + What are the individual elements that make up that step of the funnel
   + How much does each facet contribute to the greater conversion rate
   + What is the most significant factor by:
     + Number of users
      + Amount of GMV
      + Room for growth
1. User value
   + Importance, Satisfaction, Opportunity Scores
     + BATNA
     + Table stakes
     + Minimum Acceptable Threshold
1. Feasibility
1. Defensibility
    + Will this result in a moat?

## Level of Focus
When it comes to targeting users, you can priortized based on format-specific features (eg between pedestrians or automobile drives) or within-format differences (male drivers vs female drivers).
