# Product Prioritization
When it comes to prioritizing a product there are some considerations 
+ How confident are you that know what people are trying to accomplish and the tradeoffs they would make?
+ What is the scope of solutions that you would consider? Are you interested in only doing sustain innvoations, adjacent features, or entirely new solution spaces.

## Process for High-Risk Situations
+ NPV of solutions
  + Likelihood to adopt * Number of Users * change in LTV (GMV  *  Churn Rate)
## Process for Low-Risk Situations
