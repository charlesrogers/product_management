# Discover Objectives

## Strategic Interviews
There are many ways to uncover "pain points" in a job, and the following 4 questions are quite useful in doing so:
1. Speed - "What makes [step x] time consuming, slow, difficult to execute, complex, mentally taxing, etc."
2. Variance - "What makes [step x] unstable, unreliable, unpredictable, go off track, etc."
3. Cost- "What makes [step x] error prone, costly, wasteful, limit its output, inefficient, etc..."
4. I think one on efficacy belongs here... "What makes step x unsuccessful, not meet quality targets, etc..."
*The first 3 are directly from the ODI methodology.*

For example, "What makes selecting a vendor error prone, inefficient, etc."
That being said, some people will just say, "...uhh, nothing" so at the same time we can ask questions that reveal the same thing if those initial questions don't yeild any challenges.
It depends at what level we're thinking... if it's a specific product feature we'd ask something like:
In your role, what are your specific responsibilities?
How long do each of those take?
How many people are involved?

This will allow us to measure things by organizational investment.

If it is a higher-level issue, we'd ask at their organization level:
"What are the different high-level roles in your org?
"About how many people does your organization have working in those different roles?"
