# Discovering Objectives
Strategic Interviews
## Mapping their process
Go over a target individual's process to see what they must do to accomplish their high-level objective (job).
It helps to interview people who are experienced because those who are new often haven't faced enough setbacks to know just how complex the space truly is.
Sometimes it helps to draw a quick process diagram or timeline while they are explaining things to see if you are missing something in your understanding--if you can't acurately describe their job start to finish you are still missing things.
### Discovering Objectives
There are many ways to uncover "pain points" in a job, and the following 4 questions are quite useful in doing so.
At each step of the process, ask:
1. Speed - "What makes [step x] time consuming, slow, difficult to execute, complex, mentally taxing, etc."
2. Variance - "What makes [step x] unstable, unreliable, unpredictable, go off track, etc."
3. Cost- "What makes [step x] error prone, costly, wasteful, limit its output, inefficient, etc..."
4. I think one on efficacy belongs here... "What makes step x unsuccessful, not meet quality targets, etc..."

*The first 3 are directly from the ODI methodology.*

For example, "What makes selecting a vendor error prone, inefficient, etc."
That being said, some people will just say, "...uhh, nothing" so at the same time we can ask questions that reveal the same thing if those initial questions don't yeild any challenges. For example, you could say, "okay, tell me about a time when selecting a vendor has been at least a bit challenging..."
It depends at what level we're thinking... if it's a specific product feature we'd ask something like:
In your role, what are your specific responsibilities?
How long do each of those take?
How many people are involved?


This will allow us to measure things by organizational investment.

If it is a higher-level issue, we'd ask at their organization level:
"What are the different high-level roles in your org?
"About how many people does your organization have working in those different roles?"
