# Initial Demand Measurement (Pre-Launch PMF Signals)
## Core Objective
Determine the minimum value to get enough users to adopt AND NOT exceed the acceptable churn rate, or in other words, it has to be sufficiently 1. attractive to garner adoption and 2. efficacious & pleasant to use to provide value to users over a long period of time
### Adoption
The first question is are we trying to answer is if we are
### Retention

### Equaition
LTA = ƒ(Demand * Solution * BATNA)
Demand = ƒ(Job Importance * Satisfaction)
BATNA = ƒ(
### Tradeoffs
+ Shorter feedback loops with less and lower quality data vs longer feedback loops with conclusive data
+ Leave space for things to change with additional data



## Ways to Measure Initial Demand 
### LTA
### WTP
#### Stratagyn WTP
"How much would you pay to solve this problem perfectly?"
"15% better or more, that’s gonna be a winning product."

Ask the user how “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product?” and measure the percent who answer “very disappointed.” >= 40% predicts PMF [Source](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-producst-market-fit)
Ideally this is done with users, but if you are pre-launch
Directional feedback at 40 participants
“What is the main benefit you receive from {the product}”? Look at those who are most dissappointed and build for them.
