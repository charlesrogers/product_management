# Initial Demand Measurement (Pre-Launch PMF Signals)
## Core Objective
Determine the minimum value to get enough users to adopt AND NOT exceed the acceptable churn rate, or in other words, it has to be sufficiently 1. attractive to garner adoption and 2. efficacious & pleasant to use to provide value to users over a long period of time
### Adoption
The first question is are we trying to answer is if we are
#### Value
#### Understanding/Usability

### Retention

### Equaition
LTA = ƒ(Demand * Solution * BATNA)
Demand = ƒ(Job Importance * Satisfaction)
BATNA = ƒ(




## Ways to Measure Initial Demand 
### LTA
### WTP
#### Stratagyn WTP
"How much would you pay to solve this problem perfectly?"
"15% better or more, that’s gonna be a winning product."

## Sean Ellis/Superhuman
Ask the user how “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product?” and measure the percent who answer “very disappointed.” >= 40% predicts PMF [Source](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-producst-market-fit)
Ideally this is done with users, but if you are pre-launch
Directional feedback at 40 participants
“What is the main benefit you receive from {the product}”? Look at those who are most dissappointed and build for them.

## Dealing with Small Sample Sizes
[Adjusted Wald](https://measuringu.com/calculators/wald/) is used for estimating outcomes with small sample sizes.


## Maximum Acceptable Churn Rate
A high churn rate means you can add tons of new customers but have the same amount of revenue as last year

## Mitigating Risk
Measuring demand before you actually are selling the product is a form of prophecy; there is tension where we must balance balances COST and TIME. We could execute a study where we get a statistically-significant sample for our potential segments, but the time and budget requirerd to do that would suffocate any innovation; in fact that is what we are precisely trying to do: accelaerte the rate of learning. We don't have to know the exact GPS coordiantes of the desintation from day one, but we do need to know the direction of the NEXT STEP.
### Fast Cycles = Tradeoffs
+ Shorter feedback loops with less and lower quality data vs longer feedback loops with conclusive data
+ Leave space for things to change with additional data
