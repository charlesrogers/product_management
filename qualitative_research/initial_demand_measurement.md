# Initial Demand Measurement (Pre-Launch PMF Signals)

## Core Objective
Determine the minimum value to get enough users to adopt AND NOT exceed the acceptable churn rate, or in other words, it has to be sufficiently 1. attractive to garner adoption and 2. efficacious & pleasant to use to provide value to users over a long period of time
### Adoption
The first question is are we trying to answer is if we are
#### Value
#### Understanding/Usability

## Establishing a Hurdle Rate
[^1]
[^1]:

### Retention

### Equaition
LTA Equation
If we were to break down the factors influencing a potential user's Likelihood to Adopt (independent of usability factors) it would likely be a function of the following factors:
LTA = ƒ(Demand * Solution Value)
Opportunity = ƒ(JTBD Importance - JTBD Satisfaction)
Solution Value = ƒ(Solution Efficacy/Minimum Switching Value)  Must be > 1
Solution Efficacy = ƒ(Solution Relevance * Product Capability)
Minimum Switching Value = ƒ(BATNA + Switching Cost))

## Ways to Measure Initial Demand 
### Job Importance
### LTA
Need to define the following to get a somewhat accurate estimate
+ Features 
+ Target Price
### WTP
#### Stratagyn WTP
"How much would you pay to solve this problem perfectly?"
"15% better or more, that’s gonna be a winning product."

## Sean Ellis/Superhuman
Ask the user how “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product?” and measure the percent who answer “very disappointed.” >= 40% predicts PMF [Source](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-producst-market-fit)
[Actual Superhumna Segmentation](https://coda.io/@rahulvohra/superhuman-product-market-fit-engine)
Ideally this is done with users, but if you are pre-launch
Directional feedback at 40 participants
“What is the main benefit you receive from {the product}”? Look at those who are most dissappointed and build for them.
## Segmentation
### Vista Equity Partners
### Constellation

## Dealing with Small Sample Sizes
[Adjusted Wald](https://measuringu.com/calculators/wald/) is used for estimating outcomes with small sample sizes.


## Maximum Acceptable Churn Rate
A high churn rate means you can add tons of new customers but have the same amount of revenue as last year

## Mitigating Risk
Measuring demand before you actually are selling the product is a form of prophecy; there is tension where we must balance balances COST and TIME. We could execute a study where we get a statistically-significant sample for our potential segments, but the time and budget requirerd to do that would suffocate any innovation; in fact that is what we are precisely trying to do: accelaerte the rate of learning. We don't have to know the exact GPS coordiantes of the desintation from day one, but we do need to know the direction of the NEXT STEP.
### Fast Cycles = Tradeoffs
+ Shorter feedback loops with less and lower quality data vs longer feedback loops with conclusive data
+ Leave space for things to change with additional data

# Standard Operating Procedure For Pre-Launch Demand Measurement

Find what number of people who are VERY EXCITED about the product to exist?
Depends on how many of them are in the populations:
+ Show product
+ Find people exicted
  + Define How
+ Measure number of people who meet that criteria
If enough
Interview more and confirm they meet the same % of LTA
Launch product and hit milestone
IF NOT
Add features until we get to enough people to hit + ROI

# Likelihood to Adopt
## Qualitative
## Quantitative
Best-worst scaling surveys (Max-Diff)
Thurstonial models


#Usefulness 1.5 more important than Usability
