# How do I turn a "job" into an actionable insight?
JTBD helps us frame core user goals that are useful from a 30,000 foot perspective, but often are too high level to guide prioritization at the product & feature levels.
Defining the sub (and sub-sub) goals related to that core job creates an accurate model of user behavior which clarifies what tradeoffs to make at which levels.
## JOB LEVELS
Level	Level Name	Definition	Example
| Level  | Level Name | Definition | Example | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Core job  | The core goal the user wants to accomplish  | Manage household finances  |
| 2  | Job step  | The high-level steps required to compete the job | Create a budget; track budget see post on Job Steps |
| 3  | Job sub-step  | These are the steps to accomplish the "Job steps"  | Estimate monthly expenses  |
| 4  | Contextual goal  | The generalized tasks required to adequately accomplish the job-sub step.  | Accurately predict how much we'll spend on food this week  |
| 5  | Implementation task  | The individual tasks required to adequately accomplish the task; These are tasks someone will actually do. | Tabulate the money spent on restaurants in the last 7 days  |
| 6  | Product-specific goals  | It's not recommended to add so much detail that details about a specific product are included (this confounds solution and objective)  | Track my reward points at McDonalds  |
| n/a  |	Experience Criteria |	These are general goals, relevant in most every situation; typically are things measured in a usability test.	| Minimize effort to onboard new app that tracks spend
	


The struck-through part doesn't add any unique information.
## A few notes:
When a goal focuses on how to accomplish to get something done AND can be applied to almost any other situation we would term it an "evaluative criteria" and best measured in a usability test.
Eg "Minimize effort to understand how to use a feature"
In an org with specialized roles, one person's "Level 4" will be another person's "Level 2"
An sub-objective can be relevant in multiple parent-level objectives (eg a level 4 is a step in multiple high-level jobs[level 1 & 2]), however it's priority and satisfaction should be evaluated with each parent context.
Typically you won't need to go beyond 5 levels if you want extensible jobs that span across products (which is the express purpose of JTBD: to separate supply from demand)
As each step is comprised of many sub-steps, the number of goals at each sub-level can grow exponentially (see illustration below)
If we share the definition of "use case" as a "description of how users will perform tasks on your website", then the core difference is that JTBDs are independent of any product-specific constraints.

## WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A "JOB TO BE DONE" VS "USE CASES"
If our JTBDs reach a level that includes goals unique to a particular product it reaches Job Level 6, which is no longer extensible to all other products as it has merged a user's "demand" with parameters related to one specific product's "supply".
One example for a travel product might be
JTBD Level 5: "aggregate all my travel points to see my overall balance across airlines
JTBD Level 6/Use Case: "locate my points balance on an airline mobile application".
The offending clause is "on an airline mobile application" as product specifics changeâ€”mobile apps might disappear in the next few years, while understanding a points balance is an "eternal" need (well, as long as airlines still give miles).

In A product context, all features are all ephemeral, however the core JTBD never go away.
That being said, use cases are useful when working with design XFN.
Planned future topics that will be covered:
How do Job Levels help resolve prioritization conflicts
How does JTDB offer value in defining concepts for net new innovation?
