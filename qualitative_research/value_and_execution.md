## HOW TO EVALUATE FUNCTIONALITY
Relevance: Do they not want to accomplish the core job which this features serves?
Believability: Do they not understand how the feature would help them make material progress in their core job and thus don't think it would work/be useful?
Is the cost too high for the value created (could be a low value job and thus non-consumption is the probable outcome, or they have a competitive alternative solution)?
