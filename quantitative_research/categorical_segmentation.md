# Categorical Segmentation
Categorical Segmentation should not produce as high opportunity scores as using an "outcome driven innovation" process, but the results will likely be an "interpretable model" that allows you to target potential users based on identifiable factors.
## Process
1. Determine which factors to use for segmentation 
    1. Identifiable in the population (whether to advertisers or in own database)
    1. Likley to predict the largest variance between user groups
1. Determine what types of scales to use for each factor
    1. Turning x-point scales into <x-point scales can be difficult. How do we know when to reduce the number down from, lets say 6, to 3 or 2 groups?
1. Calculate Importance, Satisfaction, and Opportunity scores by Segment (user group)
1. Determine which segments are most useful
    1. Graph opportunity scores
    1. Determine the rankings at the following levels:
        1. Segment level: Determine which objectives matter (>10 opportunity score) for each segment
        1. Objective level: Determine which segments matter for each objective
        1. Stage by Segment level: Determine which objectives matter at each stage of the user process
### How to Calculate which Segments Provide Useful Information
#### PCA
#### Correlation
#### Mutual Information
