# Quantitative Product Market Fit
## Define PMF criteria
What core product/service activities do you want users to do that indicate they are getting value out of the product?
- Create an ad
- 15 seconds on a surface
- View 1 X per Y
### Think about both sides of the market:
- Y content was created
- Z content was viewed
## Target Market
- Device
- Country
- Firmographics
- Demographics
- Psycographics
## Target Frequency
Not all products and services are used at the same interval, so consider what the target frequency is
### Determine the Usage Interval
Pick a time period, and determine if 80% of the users completed the core activity criteria twice whithin that timeframe.
