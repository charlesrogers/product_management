# Survey Creation Process 
Your survey shouldn't start with a blank page; it naturally grows out of your research plan, specifically the objectives and your key risks. 
## Why a survey
Well, I most frequently use surveys to "quantify" things, or in other words to measure the magnitude of things. We rarely use surveys to learn new information (eg "what are all the types of software do people use") as those can be learned in qualitative interviews.
Why? Well, surveys are precious resource (people's willingness to take surveys is a cherished thing so we should respect this common good), so we aim to get the highest ROI out of each questionnaire fielded, and that means having a very good idea of the landscape beforehand and using the survey to meansure frequency, amount, etc... 
## Survey Design Process
At a high level, this is how I create a survey:
+ List high level objectives of study 
+ List hypotheses to invalidate/corroborate
+ List questions that will invalidate/corroborate those hypotheses
+ List factors that would be useful in segmentation
  + Those that are identifiable by advertisers
  + Those that we predict will explain the largest variance between users

## Design Questionnaire
Take the above list and flush out each objective/key risk/hypothesis into a question.
For example, if you want to know which option is most popular

### Question Construction
There are a few main types of questions:
#### Unstructured Information
When you don't know the likely options to select, you can use an open response question (however if the survey is full of these, you might be better off, if possible, doing interviews until you have a higher-fidelity 
#### Comparison
#### Ranking
#### Facts/data
+ Time & Money - When writing quantity questions (of time or money):
+(Generally) Only include one variable in a question
  + When questions seem to break, it's likely because you are asking two questions in one. This is often when you create answers that include something like X AND Y or A AND B
+ Try and not use "Yes" or "No" Questions
  + Instead of asking "have you", ask "to which degree" questions in order to understand magnitude or frequency. It is more economical than breaking it into two questions
+ Make sure your questions are logically consistent: If two answer cannot coexist, do not allow for them to be selected
+ Clarifying statements: Standard formatting... On next line vs in question
+ Mulitple Choice:
   + Include "edge" cases in answer responses:
      + 0% as distinct from 1%
      + Not yet/Never
      + Not Applicable
+ Multiple Choice vs Multi-select
  + Make the list of answers mutually exclusive
  + Make each list of answers exhaustive
  + Format each answer, gramatically, the same way such that you could use the answer in a future question via "piping logic"
+ Free text field
  + TBD
+ Multi-select
  + TBD
+ Likert questions:
  + Require a response to all rows
  + Match Question to Ratings
+ TRY AND AVOID MULTI-SELECT (checkboxes)
+ Ideas to explore
  + Simulate results before fielding to see if you get the data you need...
### Create rough draft in a collaborative tool: 
+ Use a collaborative tool BEFORE coding survey in survey instrument. Except in cases of the simplest surveys, it is best to design the survey in a collaborative word processor to allow for people to quickly see the flow, leave comments, and make suggestions without having to take  the survey multiple times
  + Don't Interchange Words: Don't switch between words like "seller" / "supplier", "good"/ "product", or "source" / "procure".
  + Don't use internal terminology: "Customer" not "buyer" or "user"
+ Don't Use Automatic Outline Formatting... Don't use numbers provided by your word processes the outline template to denote which questions and sections should be used for the skip logic, but instead list their actual names
### Review Survey
  + Review Timeframe: Depending on the length of the survey, it should take about 2 hours to review at least twice
+ Review internally within research team and determine points of contention to test with potential survey participants
+ Review externally
  + Review the survey by reading aloud the survey with a qualified respondent:
    + Ask them if them to tell you when it is ambiguous
    + Ask, "do you have any comments about this questions?"
    + Ask "Are there any answers that are missing or confusing"?
    + Ask, "Is it hard question to answer?"
+ Review with partners
+ Update survey
### Code survey in survey instrument:
+  In order to facilitate cross-survey comparison, use a "Standard Question Bank": [A database of standard questions and responses](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_research/blob/master/quantitative_research/survey_question_bank.md) that are uniform for all demo/firmo questions and for likert/multiple-choice answers. This means you'll have the same income and age ranges and can compare results from different surveys.
Depending on the length and skip-logic, the survey should take anywhere from 2-4 (uninterrupted) hours to code
+ Survey Organizaion
  + Add a introduction on the first page of survey
  + Create the pages first
  + Give each page a descriptive name
  + Add questions
  + Add skip logic
+ Matrix questions
  + ~Randomize rows for Matrix questions~
+ PUT THE EMAIL ADDRESS QUESTION on the first page
+ Survey Final Check: 1 hour per x words to do the final testing
  + Custom Questions/Piping Logic: Ensure you didn't accidentally change the order
  + Require an answer for every page
  + Check survey page skip logic
  + For every matrix question, ensure "all" rows must be selected
  + Make sure you have underlined/bolded important phrases
### Field survey
#### Distribution
##### Email
+ Original Email
+ Follow up email
  + Make sure to exclude the participants who have already completed the survey
#### Other Distribution Channels
##### Vendors
### Incentives
+ TBD
