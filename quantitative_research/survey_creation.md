# Survey Creation Process 
## Survey Design Process
+ List hypotheses you want to invalidate/corroborate
+ List objectives
+ List questions that will invalidate/corroborate those hypotheses
+ Determine objective
## Design Questionnaire
+  Cross-Survey Comparison via Standard Question Bank: Use this database of questions for all non-project-specific survey questions.
### Question Construction
+ Time & Money - When writing quantity questions (of time or money):
+(Generally) Only include one variable in a question
  + When questions seem to break, it's likely because you are asking two questions in one. This is often when you create answers that include something like X AND Y or A AND B
+ Try and not use "Yes" or "No" Questions
  + Instead of asking "have you", ask "to which degree" questions in order to understand magnitude or frequency. It is more economical than breaking it into two questions
+ Make sure your questions are logically consistent: If two answer cannot coexist, do not allow for them to be selected
+ Clarifying statements: Standard formatting... On next line vs in question
+ Mulitple Choice:
   + Include "edge" cases in answer responses:
      + 0% as distinct from 1%
      + Not yet/Never
      + Not Applicable
+ Multiple Choice vs Multi-select
  + Make the list of answers mutually exclusive
  + Make each list of answers exhaustive
+ Free text field
  + TBD
+ Multi-select
  + TBD
+ Likert questions:
  + Require a response to all rows
  + Match Question to Ratings
+ TRY AND AVOID MULTI-SELECT (checkboxes)
+ Ideas to explore
  + Simulate results before fielding to see if you get the data you need...
### Create rough draft in a collaborative tool: 
+ Use a collaborative tool BEFORE coding survey in survey instrument. Except in cases of the simplest surveys, it is best to design the survey in a collaborative word processor to allow for people to quickly see the flow, leave comments, and make suggestions without having to take  the survey multiple times
  + Don't Interchange Words: Don't switch between words like "seller" / "supplier", "good"/ "product", or "source" / "procure".
  + Don't use internal terminology: "Customer" not "buyer" or "user"
+ Don't Use Automatic Outline Formatting... Don't use numbers provided by your word processes the outline template to denote which questions and sections should be used for the skip logic, but instead list their actual names
### Review Survey
  + Review Timeframe: Depending on the length of the survey, it should take about 2 hours to review at least twice
+ Review internally within research team and determine points of contention to test with potential survey participants
+ Review externally
  + Review the survey by reading aloud the survey with a qualified respondent:
    + Ask them if them to tell you when it is ambiguous
    + Ask, "do you have any comments about this questions?"
    + Ask "Are there any answers that are missing or confusing"?
    + Ask, "Is it hard question to answer?"
+ Review with partners
+ Update survey
### Code survey in survey instrument:
Depending on the length and skip-logic, the survey should take anywhere from 2-4 (uninterrupted) hours to code
+ Survey Organizaion
  + Add a introduction on the first page of survey
  + Create the pages first
  + Give each page a descriptive name
+ Matrix questions
  + Randomize rows for Matrix questions
+ PUT THE EMAIL ADDRESS QUESTION on the first page
+ Survey Final Check: 1 hour per x words to do the final testing
  + Custom Questions/Piping Logic: Ensure you didn't accidentally change the order
  + Require an answer for every page
  + Check survey page skip logic
  + For every matrix question, ensure "all" rows must be selected
  + Make sure you have underlined/bolded important phrases
