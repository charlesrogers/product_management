# Research KPIs
Research is a tricky space to measureâ€”our true objective is delivering value to actual humans, but our work is an early input in to the much larger product development process (which we do not directly control).
Because of this somewhat unique situation, many teams struggle with the challenge of creating measurements which are useful.  
In order to do so, there first should be agreement on the role of research. Once that is established, it is prudent to have a distinct measure of both performance and outcomes.
Common questions related to this topic are:
- How do we measure ux research success?
- How do we know if we are doing a good job?
- How do we know if we are being influential?
- How do we get people to value research?
While KPIs are important to "prove" our influence, there are other invaluable ways to [increase organizational influence](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_management/blob/master/working_with_clients.md).
## Challenge of UX Research
It is **possible to do great research** (which is often defined as "determine the relative attractiveness of the various opportunities available to us and pick the best one") while not achieving the **actual business objective** ("build features that help users accomplish their most important objectives resulting in value being captured by the company").
Therefore, measuring both our inputs (performance) and outcomes (business value) allows us to determine what is going well vs poorly, and where to focus our efforts in improving.
## Performance Goals
The critical aspect of performance goals is that they are things under *our* control.  
To use a sports analogy, we measure the quality of our play instead of just focusing on the score at the end of the game. When creating these goals, they must focus on measuring actions that result in actual high quality research; much like a great basketball shot is important to score points (and thus win games), rigor, theory creation, and timeline-based interview techniques (among others) will result in uncovering meaningful insights. 
"High quality research" will involve at least some of the following aspects:
### Example Performance Goals
- How well was the research project planned? The depth of this question should vary depending on the scope and stage of the research, but for larger projects, focus on the following questions:
  - Was the initial research request turned into falsifiable hypotheses?
  - Were those hypotheses evaluated until a satisfactory answer was discovered?
  - If there was both a qualitative and a quantitative phase of the project, were there theories created after the initial interviews that were then invalidated/corroborated in the quantitative phase?
  - Were their clear go/no-go thresholds established for the project before the research started? For example, we might say "we need to hit $XM dollars in revenue with this initiative to create value for our shareholders". If this is missing from the start, it's probable that the goalposts are moved as we fall more and more in love with our ideas and we greenlight projects that don't pass the minimum investment hurdle.
  - Was the appropriate scale of research conducted? These should vary depending on the implication of the decision, stage of the project, and our existing level of knowledge.
- How well did the research uncover the reality of the situation?
  - Were the right people included in the study?
  - Was enough information gathered so that we have an idea of the depth & breadth of the situation?
  - Were the priorities and tradeoffs clearly articulated?
- How actionable are these insights? In addition to providing insight into the general objectives of the market, in most projects there will a need to create something (this is likely not successful if the insights do not influence the end product)
  - How clearly were the objectives articulated?
  - How clearly were the objectives prioritized?
  - How clearly are the constraints articulated?
  - How clearly are the tradeoffs between the objectives and the constraints articulated? 
- How accurate are these insights?
  - This largely has to do with how things are expressed; if we're not certain, use language that expresses that level (or lack) of confidence. It's also appropriate to use actual percentages along with context on the likely range of probability. [See this brief section on working with small samples for more information on the topic](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_management/edit/master/quantitative_research/statistical_techniques.md).
- How clearly are the insights expressed? This has a lot to do with presentation design and understanding the way your partners consume information.
#### Measurement of Performance Goals
As these questions are often not measurable from objective data (eg. system logs telling you how many users sign up), there is an inherent degree of subjectivity in these questions. Measuring these on a clearly defined scale (often a 1-5 Likert) reduces the subjectivity. 
**NB Define these measurements as specifically and objectively as possible if used in actual performance reviews.**
## Outcome Goals
- Measurement of influence: To what degree were the insights & suggestions incorporated into the product strategy?
  - Did the end product address at least one of the core needs of the target user group?
  - To what degree did the end product respect the core constraints of the target user group?
- Was the target KPI reached? (This is the holy grail question, but there is often a large gap between the research and the release that this is a lagging indicator, the previous outcome goals are in-process KPIs and will let us know how likely we are to achieve this latter goal).
## Troubleshooting Breakdowns in Research Incorporation
If the goals aren't being met, sometimes it's less of a project-level issue and has to do more with the working relationship or internal company dynamics:
- Did the stakeholders agree to the KPI of the project? If there isn't agreement on the objective of the research, it's more likely-than-not that the research project *should not* move forward (barring exigent circumstances).
- Were the stakeholders involved in the actual research process? They should join in at least some interviews and participate in the post-interview debrief process of hypothesis creation.
- Is there a fractured relationship between the researcher and the other stakeholders?
- 
## "Meta" Research Goals
There are also some process and "quality of work" goals that often don't make it outside the research team, but are more focused on how the work is done:
- Throughput/Project speed
  -  Was the research done in a timely manner?
- Quality of Work: were basic research standards met?
