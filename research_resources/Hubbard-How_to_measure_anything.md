## Key Principles
### Montecarlo Simulation for NPV Calculations
Project research is determining the risk-reward profile of any decision: how much value could be created or lost by any endeavor. Each of the decisions made is made under conditions of uncertainty, therefore it is appropriate to approach the question as one of probability.  
In addition to the risk about being wrong about our estimates, the cores risks are:
+ Execution risk:
  + How much will this cost us to build? Time, money, resources... they can all be converted to a dollar amount
  + Will we build the right thing?
+ User demand risk: does the target group want what we are building
