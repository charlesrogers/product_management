# Research Frameworks & Concepts
## Outcome Driven Innovation
## Supply Side
Many people think "features" first—what can be accomplished, but not whether it is desired.
## Demand Side
## Decision Making Timeline
## Jobs To Be Done
## Four Forces
The "Four Forces" are the motivating and impeding forces that affect progress.
+ Motiving forces
  + Attractiveness of the New Solution
  + Push of the Current Situation
+ Impeding Forces
  + Fear of the Unknown
  + Habit
## Switching Cost Model
### Desirability
Desirabilty is contextual: it can depend on other priorities and thus changes with time as people mature and solve their most pressing issues. Product desirability is also contingent on how easy the product is to use.
+ How much better must something be to switch
+ Tradeoffs between objectives when one gets worse to make another better (disruption)
+ "Must haves" provide filtering criteria
+ "Nice to haves" provide ranking criteria
+ Do people use thresholds, or do they use ranks?
+ When do they use each? 
+ Is it relative?
+ Maybe absolute distance matters more?
+ Maybe you are trying to minimize total distance
+ Perception questions
+ Familiarity with x
+ Gap between perception and reality
+ There is probably a framework for this
+ "Solution-specific" requirements (eg "I need US suppliers for my medical device company" OR "I need a manufacturer")
+ When are they flexible?
+ How flexible are they?
+ Why do they happen?
## Types of Innovations
### Sustaining Innovations
### Disruptive Innovation
## Local Maxima
Lower-risk opportunities (often "low-hanging fruit") are typically sustaining innovations that focus on making the existing feature perform its _current_ function better—this is inherently an optimization. They are often revealed as you analyze the conversion rate funnel of a feature or product. The risk of this type of innovation is that you reach a "local maximum" where you have made a very efficient tool, but that that tool isn't fully effective in solving their user's core objective.

## Kano Model
The [Kano Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model) provides an alternate model that provides a vocabulary to decribe importance and satisfaction from a supply side... instead of looking at objectives, you are looking at features first.
+ Must-Be's are table stakes
+ One-dimensional qualities are things that are moderately satisfied but not extremely important
+ Attractive qualities are objectives that are not very satisfied
+ Indifferent qualities are unimportnat objectives (or features that are already very or extremely satisfied)
+ Reverse quality is what happens when you merge two competing objectives and don't segment  

Importantly, the Kano model also takes into account time: while some thoughtful innovations start out being "delighters", over time they are adopted by the competition and become table stakes.
