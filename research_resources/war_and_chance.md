Much of what we do in research is to describe uncertainty. While [your model](theory_building_in_research.md) will describe what happens, you still need to describe where your theory applies, and that is best done in terms of frequency and likelihood.

Additionally, Michael Mouboussin is a great resource on this and many other topics (and the person who recommended War and Chance). Here is a graphic from his related HBR article, [If You Say Something Is “Likely,” How Likely Do People Think It Is?](https://hbr.org/2018/07/if-you-say-something-is-likely-how-likely-do-people-think-it-is)
