# Research Plan Template
## Elements of a Research Plan
### Objectives
+ What outcomes do we want? Why we are doing this project?
### KPIs/Metrics
+ What is the measurable business objective (KPI) / How will success be evaluated
+ What are the assumptions that undergird this KPI
  + What part of the conversion rate are we trying to effect?
  + If we do materially improve the conversion rate of this step in the funnel, will it result in a meaningful outcome?
+ Prevent Short-Sightedness and ignoring interrelated factors
  + As we optimize this KPI, what other important aspects should we make sure to not disrupt?
  + What is the counter KPI?
+ What is the threshold at which the outcome would be considered meaningful
### Test Plan
See [sample test plan here](https://github.com/charlesrogers/product_research/blob/master/research_templates/research_plan_template.md#sample-test-plan)
+ What are the **KEY RISKS** that must be answered to determine if this is the right path to take
  + What are the core risks that have the potential to make this project a failure?
+ What is the level of each of those risks?
+ How should we test this?
  + What information would allow us to move forward confidently?
    + What observable facts can we use to determine the true level of the key risks
      + Who is the target population
      + Who should not be considered
    + What is best determined by quantitative research
      + As much as possible, server data (i.e. analytics data) should be used
    + What is best determined by qualitative research
    + What is best determined by other parties
  + When you have a feature that has >= 2 key risk, start with the greatest risk first
    + _It is sometimes hard to determine which is the "greater risk", but it is typically the one that is binary and not conditional... For example, if the questions are "do people want this" and "will this actually improve their outcome", test whether it will improve their outcome first as you can always make the feature easier to use which will make it more desirable, but you can't always make it more efficacious._
  + At what threshold do we consider the outcome to be meaningful to the business?
  + What is the maximum acceptable "range" of answer could we accept about this key risk would result in us being confident enought that the outcome of this product feature would be worth pursuing?
### Resources
+ Data requested
### Timeline
+ Deadline
+ Phases
+ Contingencies
### Communication Plan
+ Share findings of each interview within 24 hours
+ Create a outline of the deliverables and share with the stakeholders at the beginning
+ Deliverables
  + Research Report
  + Interview Notes
  + Data Analysis

## Appendix
#### Sample Test Plan

KPI | Feature | Key Risk | Risk Level | Test to Measure Risk | Test Cost |Threshold
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |---
Num of Impression | Feature A | Don't want it | High | Survey Importance Level | High | =>80% IMP
Sign up CR | Feature B | Don't know how to use it | Low | Usability Test |  Medium | >=90% Completion Rate
Adoption rate | Feature C | Don't understand value | Medium | Verbal Test value prop | Low | Likelihood to Adopt: >80% "very" or "extremely likely"
