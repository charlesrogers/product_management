# Research Plan Template
## General Guidelines
+ Always have a deadline
+ Create a outline of the deliverables at the beginning
## Elements of a Research Plan
+ Objectives
  + What outcomes do we want?
  + Why we are doing this project
  + What are the core risks that have the potential to make this project a failure? This might be the most important step
    + What information would allow us to move forward confidently?
+ KPIs/Metrics
  + What is the measurable business objective (KPI) / How will success be evaluated
  + What are the assumptions that undergird this KPI
    + What part of the conversion rate are we trying to effect?
    + If we do materially improve the conversion rate of this step in the funnel, will it result in a meaningful outcome?
  + Prevent Short-Sightedness and ignoring interrelated factors
    + As we optimize this KPI, what other important aspects should we make sure to not disrupt?
    + What is the counter KPI?
  + What is the threshold at which the outcome would be considered meaningful
+ Test Plan
  + What are the **KEY RISKS** that must be answered to determine if this is the right path to take
  + What is the level of each of those risks?
  + What observable facts can we use to determine the true level of the key risks
    + Who is the target population
    + What is best determined by quantitative research
      + As much as possible, server data (i.e. analytics data) should be used
    + What is best determined by qualitative research
    + What is best determined by other parties

  
**Sample Test Plan**

KPI | Feature | Key Risk | Risk Level | Test to Measure Risk | Threshold
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Num of Impression | Feature A | Don't want it | High | Survey Importance Level | >80% IMP
Sign up CR | Feature B | Don't know how to use it | Low | Usability Test | >=90% Completion Rate
Adoption rate | Feature C | Don't understand value | Medium | Test value prop | >80% Likelihood to Adopt
