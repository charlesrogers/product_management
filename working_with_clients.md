# Working with Clients & Stakeholders
Oftentimes it is a challenge to get the people we are working with to incorporate the research. Sometimes this is because they don't see the value, but it is quite important to diagnose the actual root cause of why the end objective was not achieved.

Ask them what their objectives are.
If things start with "we just want to know what people think about x" you *must* take a step back and figure out what they are trying to accomplish with this question. If they cannot tell you their objective clearly, in KPI format, you need to help define that as soon as possible. It's fine to note their specific questions, but quickly move to discovering what those questions are trying to accomplish and help them reframe the question into something that is falsifiable (and useful).
## Order of Operations
Generally you'll want to define the project in the following order, because if each step isn't defined before the next, it's possible that it will not serve the core objective.
1. Objective
2. KPI
3. Establish Vector of Falsifiability: What does this even mean? It just means you need to agree on what is acceptable evidence in establishing the true state of the world.
4. **Measurement Threshold**: This is just at what level do you consider results to be meaningful... if you found that something "matters" but only has an observable effect of 1% difference it's possibly not meaningful.
4. Define Questions: Once you know what you consider to be proof of something, you must then write quesitions that measure the state of that thing.
